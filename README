The kiloseconds project is a very sophisticated and exquisite, ego-boosting and mind-blowing (albeit perhaps a bit over-engineered) project which aims to provide its audience with the time in kiloseconds, since we cannot live without it. 

Commiting Rules:

Every new programming language added needs to be put in a seperate folder like for example  haskell/kilseconds.hs

Also every commit must be signed off  -s
