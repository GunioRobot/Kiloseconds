      <h2>About</h2>
      The kiloseconds project is a very sophisticated and exquisite, 
      ego-boosting and mind-blowing (albeit perhaps a bit over-engineered) 
      project which aims to provide its audience with the time in 
      kiloseconds, since we cannot live without it.

      <h3>So, what do we mean by kiloseconds?</h3>
      <div id="more-info">

	Kilowhat? Are you crazy?

	<h4>What?</h4>
	<p>
	  The time expressed in kiloseconds is written in the following form.
	  <blockquote>
	    12.345 ks
	  </blockquote>
	  <ul>
	    <li>The first two digits measure whole numbers of kiloseconds (although if the leading digit is zero, it can be ommitted)</li>
	    <li>The digits following the point express fractions of kiloseconds</li>
	    <li>There is an optional space before...</li>
	    <li><strong>ks</strong> - the symbol for kiloseconds. Note that this should be <strong>always</strong> in lower case.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

	<h4>Why?</h4>
	<p>
	  It's a way of getting some of the benefits of measuring time in a metric way, without breaking physics. Most other 'metric' time systems redefine what a second is, and this has huge complications - fancy redefining what a Newton, a Watt and a Tesla are?
	</p>
	<p>
	Why keep to minutes and hours, when these are perfectly arbitrary measurements of time - it's not even as if they divide the day into nice numbers.
	</p>
	<h4>How?</h4>
	<p>
	  The time in kiloseconds is simply the time since the beginning of the day, expressed in kiloseconds. One kilosecond is (evidently from the S.I. prefix) 1000 seconds, and so the time ranges from 0 ks (midnight) to 86.399 ks (1 second before midnight).
	</p>
	<p>
	  Also of note is that 1 hour is approximately equal to 4 ks (4 ks = 66 minutes) so activities can be split into 1 ks (16 minutes) periods quite easily
